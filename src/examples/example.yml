description: >
  The `slim-shield` orb is engineered to bolster the security of your containerized applications
    by integrating Slim.AI's best practices for container hardening. The hardened containers can be seen in the Slim.AI portal.
    To ensure the orb functions correctly, certain environment variables need to be set in your CircleCI environment:
      The environment variables SOURCE_CONNECTOR_ID, TARGET_CONNECTOR_ID, SLIM_ORG_ID and SLIM_API_TOKEN must be set in CircleCI for this orb to work.
      `TARGET_CONNECTOR_ID` & `SOURCE_CONNECTOR_ID`: These can be found in the "My Registries" section of the Slim Platform. Note that the target and source can be the same.
      `SLIM_ORG_ID`: Locate this in the "Personal Information" section, under "Organizations" in the Slim Platform.
      `SLIM_API_TOKEN`: Navigate to the "Personal Information" section in the Slim Platform and proceed to the "Tokens" subsection to obtain this token.
# Provide a use-case based example for using this orb.
# Everything in the `usage` section will be displayed in the orb registry.
# Comments are not retained.

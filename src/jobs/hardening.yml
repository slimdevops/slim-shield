  The Slim Shield automates the process of container hardening by observing the running container, understanding its requirements, and removing unnecessary components.
  It is designed to enhance the security of your containerized applications by implementing best practices for container hardening.
  The result is a more secure container image that you can access in the SlimAI portal.
# What will this job do?
# 1. Set up necessary dependencies for hardening.
# 2. Attach the current workspace.
# 3. Import necessary environment variables for hardening.
# 4. Execute hardening process through Slim CLI.
